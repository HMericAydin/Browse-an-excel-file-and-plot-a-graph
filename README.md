# Browse-an-excel-file-and-plot-a-graph

While performing tests and collecting data from the DAQ, so much data are written to the Excel file. When the test engineer plots the graphs with the data, CPU values are getting higher. Hence that situation may cause a delay or "not responding" state in our PC. To prevent that, a basic Python code has been written.

Plotting the graphs of the test results with that Python code is getting faster than the traditional one.
